'''
In this lesson we will learn about variables, variables are memory location which some data is stored.
Python allows you to store multiple variable types like string, integer, float, boolean etc.
You do not need to define the variable type or datatype and Python kind of auto detects it when the variables are define.
String can be define in ' '' or triple quote accross multiple lines

print(type(b))

c = 123.45
print(type(c))

d = True
print(type(d))

e =None
print(type(e))
