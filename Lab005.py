'''
In this lesson we will learn about variables, variables are memory location which some data is stored.
Python allows you to store multiple variable types like string, integer, float, boolean etc.
You do not need to define the variable type and Python kind of auto detects it when the variables are define.

'''

a = 'Ramesh'
print(type(a))

b = 12345
print(type(b))

c = 123.45
print(type(c))

d = True
print(type(d))
