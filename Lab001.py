#The above written code is called shebang, which defines which python version to use to run the code.
#It usually defines the location of python installed on the local machine where the python code is running 
#So that we can run code using the specific version of python. The shebang also helps in running the code without specifying
#python on the terminal while running the code Example: python3 Lab001.py, however now that we have define shebang we can directly
#type the code filename in the terminal Example: Lab001.py

#Also as we adding the comments to the file, we use # symbol to add a single line comment, if you want to add a multi line comment
# you can use the ''' symbol lets see.
''' As you can see this is a multiline comment where the symbol defines multiple lines also when the comment is done you need to end the 
comment using the same symbol. You can run the program and see if it gives you any error'''
'''Also note that the same symbol when using in the print statement takes care of the multiline statement as we will see in the 
program below '''

print('''

        ===========================
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky. ''')
